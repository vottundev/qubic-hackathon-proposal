# Qubic Hackathon Proposal

## 1. Onboarding, Documentation and Tool QA

To ensure a smooth onboarding experience for hackathon participants, Vottun will work alongside Qubic to validate the technical documentation, development environment, and pre-event support structure. This will include:

- **Validation of onboarding materials:** Reviewing and ensuring that guides for setting up development tools, configuring wallets, and accessing Qubic testnet are complete and easy to follow.
- **Prerequisites & technical verification:** Confirming that all required software dependencies, technical documentation, and configurations are clearly outlined for participants before the event.
- **Tool QA:** Testing essential tools to interact with the Qubic Network and allow users to develop on Qubic.
- **Pre-event technical assistance:** Assisting participant questions during the preparation phase and validating that troubleshooting resources are available.

## 2. Workshops

Two types of workshops will be organized to ensure proper preparation and success for the hackathon:

### Internal Workshop (Vottun + Qubic)

- A collaborative session between Vottun and Qubic teams to align on how to prepare hackers to work in the technical challenges defined by Qubic, available tools, and the event structure.
- Resolving questions and establishing roles to ensure effective coordination.

### Hackers Workshop

- A pre-hackathon workshop to explain the challenges, tools, and basic knowledge participants need to have.
- A space to resolve technical questions and offer direct support to participants.

### Hackers Communication

- Assign a moderator in Discord (preferably within a dedicated hackathon channel in Qubic) to answer questions and push notifications.
- Create and maintain a Telegram group for participants for quick communication and problem-solving.

## 3. Add Activities in Vottun Community

A dedicated track of activities will be created within the Vottun Community platform to introduce and train community members on Qubic. This will include:

- Introductory activities about the Qubic network.
- Educational materials and tutorials to support participants and the broader community.
- Certificate of skills acquired for completing all Qubic tasks.

## TOTAL COST: $12,000
